Key: [-] todo; [o] done

Todo General:
=============

o add default admin user to setup sql
o first user inserted will have id 0 - which may cause problems
o registration page
- may be able to use date/time stamp as unique id on city file - for such uses and varifying uploaded city file is the original
- use transit images
- consider going to jpg since it will work better in IE  (won't it?)
- some sort of region image feedback mechanism so people know which city they're highlighting
- better borders around cities on region map so users know where to click
o Zipping of uploads/downloads - complete region download
- support for zipped uploads
- Need to go to templating of any HTML being done in php now
o Login had html being outputted then does a redirect
o deal with expiring registrations which aren't confirmed with a login
o make login form data secure (sc_REQUEST)
o make registration form data secure (sc_REQUEST)
- make all GET/POST id's use sc_REQUEST
- make admin form use sc_REQUEST
o Improve admin region import to compare against the database not the Images dir
- make email contain url to populate the login form for convenience
- show file size beside download links (time estimate?)
o possible option for players to turn off zipped files
- add confirmation popup to resign
o tab order with register link on login page
o going directly to region url somehow bypasses check on valid user session
o regions zip download not working
o ie image tile js not working when in conjunction with the dom js

To Test:
========
- entering invalid values for all forms
o does SCORE handle regions with empty spots in the bitmap file



Idea for Browser Input Validator:
=================================
- you have basic data types:
  - FILE
  - TEXT
  - ID

- all forms use array's for name="" which specify type. 
  for example: <input type="text" name="sf[TEXT][login]">

- then in score.php a generic class looks in $_REQUEST for a
  score_form ($_REQUEST['sf']) and loads it, then validates each set of value
  types accordingly

- ids are checked for being numeric; text fields have addslashes called, file names have basename() called

You can still reference the original values in $_REQUEST['sf'] if you need unvalidated, raw values.
And you can opt not to use the SCORE forms validator by simply not naming your html form data: sf[type]



Permisisions Ideas:
======
-	permissions 0-200. each 'function' is assigned a min permission value
	anyone over that value can access that function.
